## An Upgrade Feat

In the [13th Age](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/category/products/13th-age/) roleplaying game, spellcasters have the ability to select feats that upgrage specific spells. For example, a Wizard can take a feat such that their <spell>Ray of Frost</spell> has a change to *daze* an enemy. While I'm not ready to go there yet with Pathfinder 2E spellcasters, this got me thinking at least with regard to this alternative version of the **Hydraulic Deflection** Feat. What if, like the Aasimar's **Halo**, **Hydraulic Deflection** could be upgraded with a second feat at higher levels? The most basic one that came to mind seemed pretty straightforward: increase the AC bonus.

In short, what I ended up with was a Feat that increased the AC bonus from +1 to +2. So, now, at the cost of two Ancestry Feats, an Azarketi can have a more powerful version of the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip or, in the alternative, a hands free shield that has limited utility with the <action>Shield Block</action> reaction. It's useful, but probably not game-breaking.

## Some Final Thoughts

There are still a lot of ideas as to what might become of further upgrades to **Hydraulic Deflection**. While I don't expect it to be culminate in anything as wild as growing wings or turning into a super-form, I do think there are opportunities for growth with this ability.
