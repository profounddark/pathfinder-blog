excerpt: "A few thoughts about 'the Session' as the unit of refresh for D&D-adjacent games."

Dungeons & Dragons (and most of its derivative and adjacent TTRPGs) has always tied things to *the day*. Spellcasters restore their spellcasting powers *once per day*. Some special abilities can only be used *once per day*. Magic items work *once per day*. And while that works in the classic context of "adventurers looting a dungeon," I've found that it often doesn't work that well for most of the D&D-adjacent games that I play.

## A Disclaimer in Advance
Before I really get going, I am going to start by saying that this post features a "controversial take." I say that because about 10 years ago, while playing D&D 4E, the DM suggested exactly what I'm suggesting in this article and I, as a player, was appalled. If I recall, I argued about it for nearly ten minutes. I expect that some people just won't like this, and that's fine. If you don't like it, it's not for you! But, for people who experience the same problems I tend to experience, maybe this idea will help.

## Long and Short Units of Time

Over 40+ years, D&D-adjacent games have developed a number of different ways to talk about time as it relates to how often you can do something. The day is typically the "long unit," limiting certain powers and abilities to once per game day, although the language along the lines of "recovers with a long rest" is also sometimes used. There are also short units: once per encounter (D&D 4E), once per ten minutes (PF2), recovers with a short rest (D&D 5E), and similar. In practice, a lot of thoes amount of "once per battle," although your results may vary.

In essence, characters have certain abilities or powers that they should be using every encounter, but other abilities or powers that have limited uses and should be used in a more rationed manner. It's basic resource management that has ostensibly kept more powerful abilities from being used too often. In a sense, the bigger stuff gets used once every couple of encounters instead of every time.

This system works in the classic image of D&D: brave heroes proceed further and further down into a dungeon, battling monsters and collecting treasures. When the challenge becomes to great, they stop and rest, recovering their strength and their daily abilities. Unfortunately, not all D&D-adjacent games fit that mold. If the adventure, or the story, doesn't work with the heroes fighting a bunch of battles every day, "once per day"
