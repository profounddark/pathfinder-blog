# Pathfinder Blog

This is just a basic blog about Pathfinder built with Jekyll. It isn't sophisticated in any particular regard. I just wanted something basic and fast.

## Tools Used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for writing the HTML, CSS, and whatnot.
- [Highland 2](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/index.php) for writing the actual blog posts in a text edit friendly environment.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for building the static site.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for hosting the code base and the site itself (GitHub Pages!).
