excerpt: "A simple alchemical item designed to supplement characters in situations with odorous monsters."

My first experience with Pathfinder 2E was the [Extinction Curse Adventure Path](https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse), a story where a travelling carnival or circus inadvertantly gets involved with a series of important events. One thing that's not apparent until you get near the end of the first book is that the primary enemy of the entire adventure path is [Xulgath](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=102).

Xulgath are the proper name for what Dungeons & Dragons calls troglodytes. Like their counterparts in D&D (and other games), the Xulgath of Pathfinder have a distinctive, harmful olfactory based ability: **Stench**. **Stench** is an aura that requires the character entering the aura to make a Fortitude save, becoming *Sickened 1* on a failure. In an Adventure Path featuring Xulgath in some 50% of the content, it got me thinking about what the PCs could do to help mitigate the danger of the Xulgath **Stench**.

## Alchemical Options

While there are lots of items that grant bonuses to different saves, I wanted something that felt specific to what the characters were facing. I thought about comparable situations. What would the characters do if they were facing enemies that they knew could poison them? Use an [Antidote](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=80). Similarly, in a situation where disease is a regular threat, you bring along [Antiplague](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=81). In that regard, I wanted something that worked that way.

With that in mind, I wanted to use the **Antidote** and **Antiplague** but gave it a bonus that applied to this particular threat. The **Stench** ability itself has the *olfactory* trait, so it made sense to apply it to that. I also imagined it would be useful against other breathable threats, like poison gas, so I also had the bonus apply to effects with the *inhaled* trait.
