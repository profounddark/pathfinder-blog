excerpt: "An alternative to the Azarketi Feat Hydraulic Deflection, with the intention of giving it a bit more utility and making it more comparable to other, existing Ancestry Feats."
---

In February, Paizo released the **Lost Omens Ancestry Guide**, a book that added and expanded the Ancestries and Heritages available for character creation. One Ancestry introduced alongside this new guide was the Azarketi, also known as "Low Azlanti" or "Gill Men." These peopel represent the survivors of Azlant (Golarion's Atlantis, for thoe unaware) that were captured and mutated by their ancestral enemies, the Veiled Masters, to survive underwater.

In one of my Pathfinder games, a player was inspired by the Azarketi and wanted to make an Azarketi character. To be fair, the player was really interested in doing something "like Aquaman," so we did the best we could with what we had. In selecting his Ancestry feat, the player was really interested in [**Hydraulic Deflection**](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=2299) (AG 14). The feat is relatively straightforward:

<div class="pathfinder-back">
{% include pf2-feat.html
    name="Hydraulic Deflection :a:"
    level="1"
    traits="abjuration, azarketi, concentrate, primal, water"
    content="Drawing moisture from the atmosphere, you create a disc of hovering water that deflects attacks. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn."
%}
</div>

The ability is thematically really cool. The Azarketi uses innate power over water to make a disc of water that deflects attacks. As it ends up, it sounds a lot like an existing ability: the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip. Except... the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip allows the user to <action>Shield Block</action> in addition to providing a bonus to AC.

That got me thinking: why the difference?

## Looking at Comparable Feats

I knew that there were other level 1 Ancestry Feats that granted a character the ability to cast a cantrip. A quick look through the Archives of Nethys netted me a few standout examples: **Arcane Tattoos** (CG 11), **First World Magic** (CRB 44), **Mariner's Fire** (AG 57), **Storm's Lash** (APG 26), and **Shrouded Magic** (AG 860), to name a few. At least one of them, **Arcane Tattoos**, explicitly granted access to the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip. Some allowed access to an entire spell list that included <spell>Shield</spell>. Overall, this tells me that it's not completely off base for **Hydraulic Deflection** to work more like the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip.

At this point, it would have been easy enough to say "You can cast the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up." I **could** have done that, and for most people, that would be *good enough*. But, I already had some stuff floating around in my head (and in play) that made me want to distinguish this. I looked at the Aasimar Feat, **Halo** (APG 35) as inspiration for a Feat that emulated a cantrip, but wasn't quite the cantrip.

One important different: a later Ancestry Feat *upgrades* the ability granted by the initial Feat.

## An Upgrade Feat

In the [13th Age](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/category/products/13th-age/) roleplaying game, spellcasters have the ability to select feats that upgrage specific spells. For example, a Wizard can take a feat such that their <spell>Ray of Frost</spell> has a change to *daze* an enemy. While I'm not ready to go there yet with Pathfinder 2E spellcasters, this got me thinking at least with regard to this alternative version of the **Hydraulic Deflection** Feat. What if, like the Aasimar's **Halo**, **Hydraulic Deflection** could be upgraded with a second feat at higher levels? The most basic one that came to mind seemed pretty straightforward: increase the AC bonus.

In short, what I ended up with was a Feat that increased the AC bonus from +1 to +2. So, now, at the cost of two Ancestry Feats, an Azarketi can have a more powerful version of the <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip or, in the alternative, a hands free shield that has limited utility with the <action>Shield Block</action> reaction. It's useful, but probably not game-breaking.

## Updated Azarketi Ancestry Feats

<div class="pathfinder-back">
{% include pf2-feat.html
    name="Hydraulic Deflection :a:"
    level="1"
    traits="abjuration, azarketi, concentrate, primal, water"
    content="Drawing moisture from the atmosphere, you create a disc of hovering water that deflects attacks. This has the effects of a primal <spell>Shield</spell> cantrip, except it loses the force trait and gains the water trait. This cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up."
%}

{% include pf2-feat.html
    name="Hydraulic Barrier"
    level="9"
    traits="azarketi"
    prereq="Hydraulic Deflection"
    content="Your mastery over water has allowed you to better protect yourself from attack. When you use <action>Hydraulic Deflection</action>, the circumstance bonus you gain to AC is increased to +2."
%}
</div>

## Some Final Thoughts

There are still a lot of ideas as to what might become of further upgrades to **Hydraulic Deflection**. While I don't expect it to be culminate in anything as wild as growing wings or turning into a super-form, I do think there are opportunities for growth with this ability.
