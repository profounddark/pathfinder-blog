# About the Book of Profound Darkness

This very basic blog is just a place where I can write out ideas and thoughts, mostly about tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) and **most specifically** about the [Pathfinder Second Edition Roleplaying Game](https://paizo.com/pathfinder). Nearly a decade ago, when I was playing a significant amount of Dungeons & Dragons 4E, I blogged about my experiences and some of the somewhat strange "homebrew" content I was doing. I have recently gotten in to playing Pathfinder 2E a lot, so I thought it would be appropriate to document my endeavors in a similar fashion.

## About the Blog

This Blog is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). What little styling you see was done entirely by hand, although I took a lot of CSS ideas from [scribe.pf2.tools/](https://scribe.pf2.tools/). Don't look too close at the underlying webstuff, as it's far from clean. It's forever a work in progress.

## About the Profound Darkness

Before anybody asks, "Profound Darkness" is a name I've used in some capacity or another since the early 00s. It was actually the name of my very first website, which was essentially a blog before most people knew what a blog was. The name is a reference to 1993's *Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millenium*, where the reoccurring series villain **Dark Force** is revealed to be just an instance of a greater evil known as **The Profound Darkness**. I've always thought the name was delightfully silly.

With that being said, this website has no affiliation with the *Phantasy Star* series or **Sega**.
