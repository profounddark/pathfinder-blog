    <h1>Dealing With A Stinky Situation - 19 Apr 2021</h1>

<p>My first experience with Pathfinder 2E was the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse">Extinction Curse Adventure Path</a>, a story where a travelling circus inadvertantly gets involved with a series of very important events. One thing that’s not apparent until you get near the end of the first book is that the primary enemy of the entire adventure path is the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=102">Xulgath</a>, lizard people that live deep underground that are known for smelling very bad.</p>

<p>Xulgath are the proper name for what Dungeons &amp; Dragons calls troglodytes. Like their counterparts in D&amp;D (and other games), the Xulgath of Pathfinder have a distinctive, harmful olfactory based ability: <strong>Stench</strong>. Basically, they stink SO BAD that it makes it harder to do things. <strong>Stench</strong> is an aura that requires the character entering the aura to make a Fortitude save, becoming <em>Sickened 1</em> on a failure. In an Adventure Path featuring Xulgath in some 50% of the content, it got me thinking about what the PCs could do to help mitigate this problem. I started thinking, “wait, if I know I’m going to be fighting really stinky lizard people, maybe I’d do something to help mitigate that?”</p>

<p>There are quite a few different ways to get bonuses to saving throws in Pathfinder 2E. With normal item advancement, characters should get an Armor Resiliency rune that gives them a bonus to all saving throws (from +1 at level 8 to +3 at level 20). However, I wanted something specific to the scenario. It made sense to me that this is the kind of thing that brave adventuerers would prepare for, just like they might prepare for a dragon’s firey breath or a scorpions poison. I thought about comparable situations. What would the characters do if they were facing enemies that they knew could poison them? Use an <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=80">Antidote</a>. Similarly, if you know you will be facing monsters that use fear, you bring along <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=84">Bravo’s Brew</a>. I wanted something that player characters could make the choice to prepare for.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I wanted to use the <strong>Antidote</strong> as a model but gave it a bonus that applied to this particular threat. The <strong>Stench</strong> ability itself has the <em>olfactory</em> trait, so it made sense to apply it to that. I also imagined it would be useful against other breathable threats, so I looked through the list of traits to find things that sounded like <em>smells</em>. With that in mind, I found that poisons can have the <em>inahled</em> trait, so I added that to my list.</p>

<p>The resulting item is pretty basic. It’s really just the <strong>Antidote</strong> elixir but with the target effects being things with the <em>olfactory</em> or <em>inhaled</em> trait. As far as “homebrew” goes, it doesn’t get any simpler than this. But, with stinky Xulgath around every corner, it’s not a bad thing to have around.</p>
