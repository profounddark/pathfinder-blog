<p>This very basic blog is just a place where I can write out ideas and thoughts, mostly about tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) and <strong>most specifically</strong> about the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder">Pathfinder Second Edition Roleplaying Game</a>. Nearly a decade ago, when I was playing a significant amount of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4E, I blogged about my experiences and some of the somewhat strange “homebrew” content I was doing. I have recently gotten in to playing Pathfinder 2E a lot, so I thought it would be appropriate to document my endeavors in a similar fashion.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-blog">About the Blog</h2>

<p>This Blog is built in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. What little styling you see was done entirely by hand, although I took a lot of CSS ideas from <a href="https://scribe.pf2.tools/">scribe.pf2.tools/</a>. Don’t look too close at the underlying webstuff, as it’s far from clean. It’s forever a work in progress.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-profound-darkness">About the Profound Darkness</h2>

<p>Before anybody asks, “Profound Darkness” is a name I’ve used in some capacity or another since the early 00s. It was actually the name of my very first website, which was essentially a blog before most people knew what a blog was. The name is a reference to 1993’s <em>Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millenium</em>, where the reoccurring series villain <strong>Dark Force</strong> is revealed to be just an instance of a greater evil known as <strong>The Profound Darkness</strong>. I’ve always thought the name was delightfully silly.</p>

<p>With that being said, this website has no affiliation with the <em>Phantasy Star</em> series or <strong>Sega</strong>.</p>
